# GuessTheCelebrity
[link to the code files](https://github.com/SiddharthChakraborty1/GuessTheCelebrity/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/guessthecelebrity)

This app takes a lot of time to load since we are going to the website and parsing all of it's html code to get the image link and name of the celebrity.
when I learn to parse json data in the android app, working with websites inside android apps will be faster.
